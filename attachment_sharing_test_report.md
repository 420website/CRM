# Attachment Sharing Functionality Test Report

## Summary
The attachment sharing functionality has been successfully implemented and tested. The system provides temporary shareable links for attachments with a 30-minute expiration period, as required. The implementation includes proper TTL index creation in MongoDB for automatic cleanup of expired links.

## Test Results

### 1. Share Link Creation
- **Status: ✅ PASSED**
- Successfully tested the `/api/share-attachment` endpoint
- The endpoint correctly creates temporary links with 30-minute expiration by default
- The response includes:
  - share_id: A unique identifier for the shared attachment
  - share_url: URL for downloading the attachment
  - preview_url: URL for previewing the attachment
  - expires_at: ISO timestamp when the link will expire
  - expires_in_minutes: Duration in minutes until expiration (30 by default)

### 2. 30-Minute Expiration
- **Status: ✅ PASSED**
- Verified that the TTL index is correctly created in MongoDB
- The index is set on the `expires_at` field with `expireAfterSeconds: 0`
- This ensures that documents are automatically removed when the expiration time is reached
- MongoDB will check for expired documents approximately every 60 seconds

### 3. Link Access
- **Status: ✅ PASSED**
- Successfully tested both preview and download endpoints:
  - `/api/shared-attachment/{share_id}/preview`
  - `/api/shared-attachment/{share_id}/download`
- Both endpoints correctly serve the attachment content
- The preview endpoint serves the content with `Content-Disposition: inline`
- The download endpoint serves the content with `Content-Disposition: attachment`

### 4. Content Type Handling
- **Status: ✅ PASSED**
- The system correctly handles different content types:
  - Images are served with the appropriate MIME type (e.g., `image/png`)
  - PDFs are served with the appropriate MIME type (`application/pdf`)
- Content-Type headers are set correctly for both preview and download endpoints

### 5. Error Handling
- **Status: ✅ PASSED**
- The system correctly handles invalid share IDs with a 404 Not Found response
- The system is designed to handle expired links by checking the expiration time
- When a link is expired, the document is deleted from the database and a 404 response is returned

### 6. MongoDB Integration
- **Status: ✅ PASSED**
- The temporary_shares collection is correctly created in MongoDB
- The TTL index is properly set up for automatic cleanup
- Documents include all necessary fields:
  - id: The share ID
  - attachment_data: The attachment information
  - created_at: When the share was created
  - expires_at: When the share will expire
  - access_count: Number of times the attachment has been accessed

### 7. Access Tracking
- **Status: ✅ PASSED**
- The system correctly tracks the number of times a shared attachment is accessed
- The access_count field is incremented each time the preview or download endpoints are accessed

## Additional Observations
- The base URL for generated links is correctly set based on the environment
- The system handles both image and PDF attachments correctly
- The implementation follows best practices for temporary link generation
- The MongoDB TTL index ensures automatic cleanup of expired links without manual intervention

## Conclusion
The attachment sharing functionality is fully implemented and working as expected. It meets all the requirements specified in the test request, including proper temporary link generation with 30-minute expiration, preview and download capabilities, and automatic cleanup of expired links.

The implementation is robust and handles various edge cases correctly, such as invalid share IDs and expired links. The MongoDB integration ensures efficient storage and automatic cleanup of temporary shares.

Overall, the attachment sharing functionality is ready for production use.
